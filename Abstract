These days, the most crucial factor is determining the fish's freshness. Customers eat fish without 
realising how fresh it is, which puts them at risk for numerous illnesses. This is the primary 
component of quality assurance and food safety. The fish's eyes are used for the majority of 
identification. Fresh fish is primarily identified by its eyes, which should be bright and clear. If 
they are not, the fish is not edible. Fish must travel through chilly climates to get to different places. 
The merchants would therefore add a lot of chemicals to keep the dead fish fresh. Therefore, the 
goal of our investigation is to identify the chemicals that are sprayed on fish to keep them fresh.The 
formaldehyde sensor in the suggested system is capable of identifying the volatile organic 
compounds of formaldehyde that merchants wrap fish surfaces in order to extend their shelf life. 
Subsequently, the dataset will be shown, comprising of real-time iris photographs of fish eyes 
gathered from the internet.  The accuracy of the formaldehyde sensor in use is 1â€“50 ppm. The 
formaldehyde test will only be carried out if the fish is determined to be fresh and to determine 
whether or not it contains any chemicals. We won't do the formaldehyde test if the fish is 
determined to not be fresh. The suggested work helps the consumer choose which fish is safe to 
eat.
