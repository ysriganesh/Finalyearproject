One of the marine resources that is crucial for meeting the body's nutritional demands is 
fish [1-3]. The body needs vitamins, minerals, and proteins found in fish to lower the risk of cancer, 
heart disease, and stroke; it can also be used to treat high blood pressure and increase IQ 
(intellectual quotient) [4â€“7]. Between 1961 and 2018, the sources of marine fish supply rose from 
9.0 kg/capita to 20.5 kg/capita [8, 9]. Fish intended for public consumption made up 52% of the 
aquatic food produced in 2018 (46%), which came from the sea [9]. The demand for food would 
rise by 20% to 70% due to the projected 9.7 billion people on the planet by 2050 [10]. The average 
annual intake of fish and fish products processed worldwide is 18.4 kg, with 128 million tones 
consumed worldwide [4]. Indonesia currently has the fourth-largest population, and by 2045, it is 
expected to reach 318.9 million [11]. As the world's second-largest fish producer after China, 
Indonesia contributes significantly to the economy through raising incomes, varying sources of 
revenue, obtaining foreign exchange, and supplying animal protein [3, 12]. Fish contributes 
approximately 47.23%, or 12.57 g/day, of the total animal protein need, with daily animal protein 
consumption meeting 26.61% of the requirement [13]. 
Freshness is a crucial component of fish quality, and fish management organisations place a lot of 
importance on evaluating it [16]. Fish management practices by businesses and fish markets are 
crucial in determining the quality of fish that will be sold to consumers because, after being caught, 
fish go through a degradation process that is brought on by bacterial growth, biochemical reactions, 
and physical and chemical changes in the fish body. This process lowers the fish's quality [4, 14, 
17-21]. 
When fish are fresh, they look and feel just like live fish, but when they are rotten, their body 
chemistry causes the gills, skin, meat, and eyeballs to turn discoloured and give off an 
overpowering stench [4, 23]. Eating rotten fish can cause health difficulties for the consumer, 
including diarrhoea, vomiting, respiratory issues, and cramping in the stomach [7, 24]. When it 
comes to managing the process of catching and distributing fish to consumers, fish management 
firms, market managers, and the government should be concerned about the significance of fish 
freshness as an indicator of fish quality [16, 25]. The process of keeping an eye on and assessing 
the freshness of fish is intimately linked to attempts to regulate its distribution [26]. A variety of 
techniques based on physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory factors can be used to 
monitor and evaluate the freshness of fish [16, 27]. 
Fish freshness and quality qualities are assessed by correlating sensory criteria with quantitative 
chemical and physical approaches. The quantitative chemical and physical methods mentioned 
above have several drawbacks, including the need for highly qualified operators, significant costs, 
and time commitment. Furthermore, they cannot be used for online or in-field detection. 
Furthermore, the fact that they take a long time is bad since, due to their quick spoiling, fish must 
frequently be sold the same day they are killed. With the exception of sensors, the more cutting
edge sensing techniques could solve these issues because they are quick, affordable, and non
invasive, enabling online detection [27]  
The identification and detection of formaldehyde coating in fish that can be eaten has showed 
promise in recent years when Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been used [28][29]. IoT 
technology consists of networked sensors and devices that gather and send data that may be 
examined to find patterns [28]. By taking into account the fish's iris photos, machine learning 
techniques convolutional neural networks (CNN) in particular have been effectively used to 
determine the freshness of edible fish [30]. 
An crucial metabolic intermediate is formaldehyde.generated in every cell as a result of the 
metabolism of amino acids like methionine, glycine, and serine. Choline. On the other hand, 
formaldehyde is a very harmful chemical that can cause cancer in people. According to Zhang et 
al. (2008), long-term inhalation can cause respiratory symptoms as well as eye, nose, and throat 
irritation caused by formaldehyde in seafood. Exposure to this chemical can raise the risk of 
allergic responses, dermatitis, and brain, nasopharyngeal, and pharyngeal malignancies. An adult 
human has been reported to die after ingesting 30 millilitres of formalin. Consumption may result 
in a corrosive harm to the mucosa of the stomach, causing pain, nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and 
perforation. The pharyngeal mucosa, epiglottis, and oesophagus are the areas where these injuries 
are most noticeable. Metabolic acidosis, coma and depression of the central nervous system, 
respiratory distress, renal failure, and the development of cancer and tumours are examples of 
systemic consequences. Formaldehyde has the potential to enter and remain in the upper 
respiratory tract after inhalation. Based on experimental research and other data, formaldehyde 
was long regarded as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2A). Based on evidence of 
nasopharyngeal cancer in humans, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 
categorised it as a human carcinogen (Group 1) in June 2004 [31]. 
The natural production of formaldehyde in a variety of food products, especially fish, makes it 
difficult to identify amounts that have been unlawfully added. Based on developmental phases and 
environmental conditions, naturally occurring formaldehyde levels can vary greatly; they can 
range from 0.1-0.3 mg kg-1 in milk to over 200 mg kg-1 in certain fish species. Fish that are stored 
at different temperatures and for longer periods of time produce less trimethylamine-N-oxide, 
which leads to the post-mortem production of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde levels in seafood have 
been the subject of numerous research, which have highlighted its complexity and consequences 
for food safety [31]  
In this study, the aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the methods and techniques used 
for the identification and detection of freshness and chemical substances in edible fishes
